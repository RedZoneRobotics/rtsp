rtsp
====

`rtsp` implements RTSP in Go. The development focus is for video streaming from security cameras, but the library is developed such that it should be useful for any type of stream.

Currently, `rtp` and `rtcp` are implemented as sub-packages, but this will likely change once the library matures.
